## How is back compatibility handled?

### What about supporting a span of versions?

Ans:  Spanning more than one version of a component will means a proliferation of test cases, so the recommendation is to be a point in time and not 'this latest version and that slightly older version'.

This will reduce the code test sets to a single configuration (tested in many ways anyways).


### How are features and functionality removed or depreceated?

Ans: When a specific technique or function is removed one should:
#### create a ticket describing the change to be performed
#### depending on how invasive the change is, remove the elements or
#### if desiring a 'sunset' of the feature comment out the dependant lines with:
##### #Deprecated:YYYY-MM-DD:TODO: [remove next release|short phrase of action here]

# Style Guide

## How are file paths as variables referred to -- trailing slash or no trailing slash?
### No trailing slash. /this/is/the/way  /not/this/way/  

## How should I make changes to configuraiton files that are sustainable and can cross version updates?
####  This is a hard one.  It's more of a process to choose a technique than 'always do it this way'

In our case we have various files but ususally they are:

.properties name value pairs
	- these can be updated in two ways:
	-- using SED to tweak the file in place
		--- useful if something is just 'uncomment this and go'
	-- concatenating something at the end of a file
		--- an ok approach and a bit more free-form.  
		----  Risks: Sacrifices readability
		----  duplicate values may occur unknowingly.

.xml structured XML files 
	- updating these files usually uses:
	-- SED for surgical replacement finding a discrete string
	-- templating the file completely with one of our own
	-- applying a diff shipped in our code against a known distribution
	-- RISKS:
	--- templating is preferred and diffs have been used but are more fragile
	--- TBD -- more to come

## How do you handle files that have dependancies? Fetch them in real time or bundle them with the zip of the installer?

### This is a challenge as it is a balancing act between 'simply update things by changing a version number' and 'I have to do a build and test because some small library changed'.

Once again, it's a process to analyze the material sway and impact against the overall stability of the build.
The preference of we the maintainers is to have a build that is resilient to failure and strive for a build that WARNS of errors on a customization but installs the IDP.  So a 'graceful' fail scenario that results as best possible in an IdP installation.

Wherever possible:
- Bundle the dependancy as long as it doesn't violate the intent of the licencing.
- Alert the installer that there a number of dependancies being automatically installed and highlight any significant assumptions being made.


## What's the practice around backing up files?

### It is strongly recommended to backup the file in place with a consistent prefix using the 'fileBkpPostfix' variable prefixed with a dot.  This allows review post installation against what was done and what was in the distribution.


## What's the practice around naming files that we carry leverage?

The file naming convention is an evolution and while consistency is desired, it has some inconsistencies.
If you would like to open a ticket to resolve specific items, please feel free to do so.
The current practices:

Common extensions
- *.sh
- *.template


## What's the practice around using SED?

sed's behaviour across the various flavours of unix varies. 
We commonly use the -i feature ('inplace') and this is slightly different depending on the variable
